## Getting Started

Clone the code run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## File Structure

**pages** and **components** are two main folders which compile are the pages you are seeing on https://nextjs-challenge-pi.vercel.app/

## TailwindCSS Settings

Configuration setup for TailwindCSS in ```tailwind.config.js``` file which includes color, font sizes and font weights as for now.

## Deploy on Vercel

Application connected to Vercel, whenever we push the code onto the **main** branch, it'll automatically start building and then deploy.

## Note

As figma pages designed according to mobile-first approach, I implemented in that way as well. I want you to see the implemented pages in mobile view for better understanding.

Thank you.
